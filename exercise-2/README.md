# Exercise-2
Nearly all of our R exercises will follow the same format, requiring the following steps:

1. As you've done before, fork this repository to your own GitHub account
2. Clone the repository to your machine
3. Open the `exercise.R` file in Rstudio, and follow the instructions there.
4. When you're done, `add` and `commit` your changes
5. Push your changes back to GitHub
